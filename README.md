## Inspiration
This is our first blockchain web app.

## What it does
This can help you search for a certain value for a cryptocurrency.

## How we built it
We used python and some blockchain tech to build it.

## Challenges we ran into
We tried to use Hedera at it's best, but unfortunately, after help from all the friendly and patient community members, it still didn't work. So we switched to use other services.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Create our first blockchain (sort of) website.

## What we learned
We learned the basic of blockchain and hedera
